                <p>Bihar history can be traced back to the Prehistoric Period and is very
                    ancient.
                    The earliest history can be traced in the Hindu epic of Ramayana.
                    Mithila was the birthplace of Lord Ram wife, Sita.
                    The author of The Ramayan, Maharishi Valmiki live in ancient Bihar.
                </p>
                <p>Mahajanpada period and the rule of the Magadhan empire brings glory to ancient Bihar.
                    Pataliputra (Patna) was the capital of ancient India’s powerful Magadha kingdom.
                    Bihar has experienced various invasions from different dynasties.
                    Two of India’s most glorious dynasties, Mauryas (321 -185 BCE) and Guptas (320 to 550 CE) flourished
                    in
                    ancient Bihar region which was then known as Magadh.
                </p>
                <p>The Mauryan emperor, Ashoka (born c.304 BCE, died c. 232 BCE), who was born in Pataliputra (Patna) is
                    believed to be one of the greatest rulers in the history of the world.
                    The Great King Ashoka of Mauryan dynasty whose empire spread across South Asia, had his capital in
                    Pataliputra that is present Patna.
                    It was a prosperous center of India’s ancient civilization.
                    Bihar has been associated with Chandragupta Maurya and Emperor Ashoka one of the greatest empires in
                    India.
                    There were 19 thousand Buddhist monasteries in Magadha during Emperor Ashoka.
                </p>
                <p>The great spiritual way of Buddhism originated and thrived in ancient Bihar, as Budda attained his
                    enlightenment in Bodhgaya.
                    Therefore the region is full of remains of the monasteries known as Stupa.
                    Jain leader Mahavira also belonged to this region and attained his Nirvana at Pawapuri.
                </p>
                <p>In the medieval times, Bihar was at its peak during the reign of Sher Shah Suri who founded the city
                    of
                    Patna on the ancient land of Pataliputra.
                    The reign of the great Afghan ruler Sher Shah Suri who ruled from Patna and built the Grand Trunk
                    Road
                    the longest road of India.
                    Bihar saw a span of five years of good governance.</p>
                <p>During British rule, Mahatma Gandhi started his first experiment of Satyagraha movement from the
                    Champaran region against the oppression of the indigo farmers by the Britishers.
                    Bihar remained a part of the Bengal Presidency of British India until December 1911, when it was
                    separated from the Bengal Presidency while Bihar and Orissa comprised a single province.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The constitution of the United Bihar and Orissa was changed to separate the state of Bihar in 1936.
                    The
                    present form of Bihar came into existence on 01 November 1956. In 2000, Jharkhand was made separate
                    state from Bihar.

                        The state is naturally divided by the Ganges (Ganga) River into two regions—the North Bihar
                        Plains
                        and the South Bihar Plains, which together form part of the middle Gangetic Plain.
                        Except for the foothills of the Himalayas in the extreme northwest, the North Bihar Plain is a
                        flat
                        alluvial region, less than 250 feet (75 metres) above sea level and prone to flooding.
                        The Ghaghara, the Gandak, the Baghmati, the Kosi, the Mahananda, and other rivers flow down from
                        the
                        Himalayas of Nepal and make their way to the Ganges in frequently changing channels.
                        Depressions and lakes mark the abandoned courses of streams.
                        The Kosi River, long known as the “Sorrow of Bihar” for its tendency to cause destructive
                        floods,
                        has been confined within artificial embankments.
                        The soil of the northern plain consists mostly of new alluvium—chalky and light-textured (mostly
                        sandy loam) west of the Burhi (Old) Gandak River and nonchalky and heavy-textured (clay and clay
                        loam) to the east.
                        Another natural hazard—seismic activity—also affects this area, which lies within the Himalayan
                        earthquake zone.
                        The earthquakes of 1934 and 1988 were especially severe and caused widespread devastation and
                        loss
                        of life.

                    <p>
                        There are three well-defined seasons: the hot-weather season, lasting from March to mid-June;
                        the
                        season of southwest monsoon rains, from mid-June to October; and the cold-weather season, from
                        November to February.
                        May is the hottest month, with temperatures regularly exceeding 90 °F (32 °C), except in the
                        extreme
                        north.
                        The coolest month is January, with temperatures typically rising into the low 70s F (about 22
                        °C).
                        The normal annual rainfall varies from about 40 inches (1,000 mm) in the west-central part of
                        the
                        state to more than 60 inches (1,500 mm) in the extreme north.
                        Nearly all the rain falls between June and October, with July and August being the wettest
                        months.
                        The cold-weather season is the most pleasant part of the year.

                    </h3>
                    <p>About half of Bihar is under cultivation, but population pressure has pushed cultivation to the
                        furthest limits, and little remains to be developed.
                        The transitional nature of the climatic zone is reflected in the cropping pattern, which shows a
                        mixture of wet and dry crops.
                        Rice is everywhere the dominant crop, but wheat, corn (maize), barley, and pulses (legumes) are
                        important supplementary crops.
                        Sugarcane is grown in a fairly well-defined belt in the northwest. Jute, a crop of the hot,
                        moist
                        lowlands, is found only in the easternmost plain districts.
                        There are three harvests in a year: bhadai, dominated by corn that is sown from May to June and
                        gathered in August and September; aghani, consisting primarily of rice sown in mid-June and
                        gathered
                        in December; and rabi, made up largely of wheat that ripens in the plains in the spring (March
                        to
                        May).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fruits and vegetables are grown extensively. Muzaffarpur and Darbhanga are particularly noted
                        for
                        mangoes, bananas, and litchi fruits.
                        Vegetables are important in the vicinity of large towns.
                        The potato-growing area near Bihar Sharif, in Patna district, produces the best variety of seed
                        potato in India.
                        Chilies and tobacco are important cash crops on the banks of the Ganges.

                    <p>Bihar’s mineral wealth was virtually depleted when the mineral-rich Chota Nagpur plateau became
                        part
                        of Jharkhand.
                        Still, there are a few pockets in the state where minerals are found. Bauxite is found in
                        Munger.
                        The Rohtas district has dolomite, glass sand, cement mortar, and other minerals. Mica deposits
                        are
                        found in Gaya, Nawada, and Munger. Gaya and Munger also produce salt, as does Muzaffarpur.

                        Bihar’s energy is provided by a small number of thermal and hydroelectric power stations, but
                        these
                        do not meet the needs of the entire state.
                        Several power stations were lost with the partitioning of Jharkhand.
                        In the early 21st century less than half of the state’s villages had regular electricity.

                            Although its history goes back to the times of the Buddha, the university at Nalanda was
                            founded
                            in the 5th century CE, and it flourished for the next 700 years.
                            Its decline began in the late Pala period, but the final blow was the invasion by Bakhtiyar
                            Khilji around 1200 CE.
                            The subjects that were taught at Nalanda included Buddhist scriptures (of both the Mahayana
                            and

                            A unique thing about the Deo temple is that it faces west unlike the traditional Sun temples
                            which face east.
                            Needless to say, Deo is the place where Chhath (Bihar’s most sacred festivals devoted to the
                            Sun
                            god) happens promptly.
                            It is considered auspicious to visit the temple during Chhath, a festival celebrated in
                            honour
                            of the Sun God in October-November when thousands of devotees perform arduous rituals over
                            four
                            days.

                            history.
                            The word ‘tikuli’ is the local term for ‘bindi’, which is usually a bright, colourful dot
                            that
                            women
                            wear between their brows.
                            In the past, the bindi was created as a symbolic means of worshipping intellect and
                            conserving
                            the

                            are various handicrafts that are made from a special kind of grass known as sikki found in
                            Bihar
                            and
                            Uttar Pradesh, India.
                            The art of making items from sikki grass is an ancient one in the province of Bihar.
                            Tharu women in the southern plains of Nepal, have been weaving traditional baskets from
                            sikki
                            grass
                            for centuries.
                            Nowadays, many Tharu women are engaged in producing sikki handicrafts through collaborative
                            networks.

                            When one hears Chhath Puja, Bihar instantly comes to the mind.
                            This is an actually an ancient Hindu festival which is dedicated to the Sun God, Surya, and
                            take
                            place 6 days after Diwali.
                            It is an expression of thanks giving and seeking blessings from the Almighty for sustaining
                            life
                            on
                            Earth.
                            During this festival, the person observing Chhath, also known as Parvati, observes a fast
                            from
                            dawn
                            to dusk which concludes with sweets.
                            This fast is followed by another fast for 36 hours till the final day, when puja starts at
                            the
                            river, before sunrise.
                            We can witness thousands of devotees and the river during this time.
                            Witnessing Chhath Puja will let you witness the devotion in its true sense.

                            Chakeba is a Hindu festival, originating from the Mithila region of the Indian subcontinent.
                            It is a festival of brothers and sisters.
                            It is celebrated in November and commences when birds begin their migration from the
                            Himalayas
                            down
                            towards the plains of India.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The festival, which includes folk theater and song, celebrates the love between brothers and
                            sisters
                            and is based on a legend recounted in the Puranas.
                            It tells the story of Sama, a daughter of Krishna who had been falsely accused of
                            wrongdoing.
                            Her father punished her by turning her into a bird, but the love and sacrifice of her
                            brother
                            Chakeva eventually allowed her to regain human form.
                            The celebration starts from the night of Chhath puja.
                            This is the 7th day of the month of Kartik.
                            Young, mostly unmarried girls assemble near the ghats of chhath with a basket containing
                            small
                            idols
                            of sama and chakeva, candles, kohl, clay made daily use appliances etc. at night.
                            They sing traditional songs, perform some rituals, like making kohl, exchanging baskets.
                            This celebration continues till Kartik Purnima.
                            On the auspicious occasion of Kartik Purnima, girls take a dip in river and the idols of
                            sama
                            and
                            chakeva are immersed in the river.
